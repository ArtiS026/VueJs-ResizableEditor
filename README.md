# VueJs-ResizableEditor
Make a simple editor based on Monaco editor and Vue.js. The editor should have 3 panes . The panes should be possible to change in size and the content should adapt in size. The editor and tutorial panes should be possible to open (button on top menu) and close (x in top right corner).
The text in the tutorial area should be possible to drag and drop into the editor area at any place.
The text in the editor could be a hard coded string or read from a file with a hard coded name.
